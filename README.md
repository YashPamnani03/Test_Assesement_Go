# Project Name

This project is a Go-based application. It includes a simple setup to demonstrate basic Go application building and execution.

## Build and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Go** installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official Go website: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Build the Application

To build the Go application, use the following command:

```bash
go build -o testFile main.go
```

This will compile the `main.go` file and generate an executable file named `testFile`.

### Run the Application

Once the build is complete, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
./testFile
```

### Check the Result

You can check the result by accessing the application locally using either of the following methods:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```

or simply by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

This should display the result of your Go application running locally on port 8080.
